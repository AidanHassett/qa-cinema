<h1>About Us</h1>
<hr></hr>
<p>
    QA Cinema was founded in March 2022 by 4 movie obsessed and coding crazy individuals as part of their final project for the QA 22JanSoftware1 cohort!
</p>
<p>
    The aim of the project was to create a fully functional cinema and meet the reuirements of a project specification.
</p>

<p>
    Most importantly, we wanted to develop a cinema that could be used by many and bring great customer satisfaction!
