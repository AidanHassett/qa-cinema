We were tasked to create a full-stack web application displaying a cinema website using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) stack. MongoDB was used to create the data layer. The back-end was built using Node, Express was used to create an API, and finally the front-end was created via React. All these were combined in order to create a webpage that was aesthetically pleasing, all while providing information and being easy and simple for users to interact with.
